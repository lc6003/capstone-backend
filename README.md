# Cashvelo Backend

## Project Idea

Cashvelo is a personal finance web app that helps users manage their money in a simple and organized way. It allows users to budget using an envelope-style system, track expenses and income, manage credit card balances, and understand their spending more easily.The app also includes a cash stuffing feature, which lets users organize physical cash into envelopes and track cash movements between them. Users can create budgets, add expenses and income, and view their financial information through clear dashboards and charts. Cashvelo also offers language options (English and Spanish), light and dark mode, and secure user login, making the app accessible and customizable for different users.
